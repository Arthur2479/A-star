## Project

A basic visual implementation of the `A* algorithm`, using `Python` and the `Processing` language

To run the program, you need to [install Processing](https://processing.org/) (I'm using version 4.2) and run it from
its IDE.  
I sadly couldn't get Processing to export an executable file, maybe it will be fixed in the future
