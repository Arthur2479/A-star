## Project

A basic visual implementation of the `A* algorithm`, using `Python` and the `Processing` language

To run the program, you need to [install Processing](https://processing.org/) (I'm using version 4.2) and run it from
its IDE.  
I sadly couldn't get Processing to export an executable file, maybe it will be fixed in the future

### Improvement ideas :

- Make groups of walls instead of random walls -> noise function with a threshold maybe ?
- Create a random maze generation project and combine it with this algorithm

TODO : fix end path when there are no diagonals
