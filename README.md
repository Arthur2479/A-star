## Project

A basic visual implementation of the `A* algorithm`, using `Python` and the `Processing` language.

To run the program, you need to [install Processing](https://processing.org/) (I'm using version 4.2) and run it from
its IDE.  
I sadly couldn't get Processing to export an executable file, maybe it will be fixed in the future.

## How to play

### Start the program

After opening the folder in Processing's IDE, click on play.  
A 800x800 window should appear, and the algorithm will immediately start searching for the end point.

### Interact with the game

There are a few ways you can interact with the simulation:

- Mouse buttons: _(Tip: you can keep them pressed and move your mouse)_

    - `Left`: add blocks
    - `Center`: move the end point
    - `Right`: remove blocks

- Keyboard keys:

    - `P`: pause the current simulation
    - `R`: restart the current simulation
    - `N`: Go to next simulation
